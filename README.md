# 🐵 The Primate Pack

A suite of plugins to add your own touch to Caido. The Primate Pack currently has 3 mini-plugins. After modifying your settings, you may need to reload Caido.

## Caido Pets
Add a GIF to the sidebar. The default is a sleeping cat. You can configure the URL of the GIF as well as its dimensions in the Settings menu.

## Nerd Sniper
Send requests to your friends directly via Discord webhooks!

### Usage
1. Ask your friend to provide you with a webhook URL for a text channel in their server.
2. Go to the Primate Pack settings, and add their Name and URL.
3. Save your settings, and visit any request tab.
4. Right click -> Plugins -> Send to (Name).
5. Done! Your friend will now receive the request in their text channel, with the `Cookie` and `Authorization` headers removed.

## Embedder
Embed any page in an iframe in Caido! You can change the name of the tab in the sidebar, as well as the URL of the page that is embedded.

### Suggested Usage
If you run some private tooling such as XSSHunter, put it behind your own VPN, or add a password. Then, set the URL for it in the Primate Pack settings and you're good to go!

## Roadmap
- Custom dimensions for Embedder (in the next few days).
- Slack webhook support for Nerd Sniper.
- Reload Caido after saving settings.
- Granular enable/disable of specific plugin features.

## Known Issues
- Please open issues if you have any problems.
