# PrimatePack
The Primate Pack is a suite of extensions for Caido.

## Requirements
- This extension can be installed using [EvenBetterExtensions](https://github.com/bebiksior/EvenBetterExtensions).
- EvenBetter is required for this extension to work.

## How to Install
- Install EvenBetterExtensions from the above link, and use the 1-Click install to install EvenBetter from it.
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab of EvenBetterExtensions and update the URL to fetch extensions from, to this: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectmonke/PrimatePack/main/extensions.json`
- This replaces the source of the extensions with the one defined by the Primate Pack. This is a temporary measure until Bebiks adds the Primate Pack to his list of one-click install extensions.
- Primate Pack should now appear in the dropdown. Use the one-click install to install the plugin, and you're set. If it doesn't appear, restart your Caido instance.
